# Sweeps

You'll need to be running node (8 or higher probably)

### Setup
`npm install`

### Running it

Change people.json to suit. The generator will distribute the teams top down evenly amongst the people. Randomly picking the person each time. This should ensure a fairer distribution of decent teams.

`node .`

JOGA BONITO!
